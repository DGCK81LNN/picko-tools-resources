Usage: picko-resizer [n]

This will look for an open instance of PICKO and resize its window to n times
the canvas size. n defaults to 1.

Use picko-resized to start PICKO and then run picko-resizer:

    picko-resized [n]

Use picko-resizer-interactive to input n in a dialog, instead of using command
line args. Just double-click on it; it should be opened with wscript.exe.
